# Simple Node crawler

The project consists of a backend (node.js + TS + MongoDB) and a frontend (React.js + TS).

Main scripts to run it locally:

 - **npm run watch**: To start only the server on port 3000.
 - **npm run client**: To start only the client on port 8000.
 - **npm run dev**: To start both the server on port 3000 and the client on port 8000.
 - **npm run test**: To run tests.
 
 Note: application response times may be a little slow depending on the case. Please be patient while the results are generated.
